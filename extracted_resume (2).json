        "ProfessionalSummary": "I am a pre-final year undergraduate student at VIT, Vellore pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My primary areas of interest are Machine Learning, Data Science and Internet of Things. I have worked as a Product Design Intern and a Machine Learning Intern, which required me to polish my skills in Arduino Programming, building Deep Learning Models such as a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Binary Classification, Machine Learning Regression Models for Predicting House Prices, Image Processing and Optical Character Recognition for Text Feature Extraction, Relational Database Management using SQL and Natural Language Processing to build a Stacking Classifier for Fake News Prediction Modelling. Having been someone who loves continuous learning, I have always wanted to explore the horizons of technology."
